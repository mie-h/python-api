Text to image NFT generation


Text -> generate image -> mint NFT


All these happen on Solana chain:
Client sends a text and a recipient address(Solana address)


- Call the dreamstudio API and generate an image
- Upload the image to NFT.storage

NFT.storage generates a link, which is a handle to an img you uploaded
IPFS (not HTTP protocol).

- Upload the image to nft.storage which returns a cid handle
- Create a link from the cid handle using this format - https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${cid}
- Upload the Token Metadata with the following format below

const tokenMetadata = {
    name: nftName, // to be passed by the client
    description: description, // same
    symbol: symbol, // same
    image: imgURI, # “https://ipfs.io/ipfs/${json.value.cid}” // CID link from above
    attributes: attributes, // User supplied 
  };

Attributes is an array that looks like this:
{
  “trait_type”: “MIE”,
  “value”: “HONESTY”,
}

- Grab the CID from token metadata upload and use it in the same format as above - https://ipfs.io/ipfs/{cid} // json url
- Pass this link along with name, description, symbol & attributes to mint function below later but first,
- Call deploy method to actually mint an NFT token which generates a mint address for the NFT
- Call mint method as mentioned before this address and recipient address

Minting NFT:
- Use deploy method - https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/python-api/blob/main/api/metaplex_api.py#L28
- Use mint - https://github.com/metaplex-foundation/python-api/blob/main/api/metaplex_api.py#L73
